This is an old clunky machine learning project to create a machine learning model for detecting types of instruments in a song.
This was used for a larger project developing an app that would use said model in realtime usiing the mobile device's microphone.

Known issues:
The dataset the model was trained on is extremely limited. Music with lots of digital effects or distortion will likely get confused with other instruments.
